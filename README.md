Meet again to go over our prototype ideas and select what to show on Wednesday

The "first-page.jpg" is the initial page of our product. From there we would render the page you are witnessing in index.html. Our initial shows the layout of potentially what it would look like. After the button is clicked, there is a pop up and later messages will be embedded.
